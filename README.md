This is an attempt to make a cryptographic software with C++ using Crypto++ Library. 

Advanced encryption standard with Cipher feedback mode are used for Encryption and Decryption.Password-based Key derivation function 2 is used to strengthen the security further.

The creation of this project shows:
  >Proper C++ files structure(.h / .cpp)
  >AES With CBC mode with PBKDF2 Key derivation function
  >Better Proficiency with C++
  >Familiarity with new functions from internal library
  >Better understanding of github functions and external dependincies
  >Better familiarity with external dependincies configurations
  >Gathered a decent understanding of Cryptographic terminology and techniques
  >EXTENSIVE problem-solving
  >Proper C++ techniques to handle memory leaks
